    "KNN algorithm â€“ is used to classify a point based on its surroundings, in which we find the points which are surrounding our variable and try to group it with the once which are close to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there is a point, which is surrounded by groups of red points and yellow points, based on the surroundings and the points close to it we categorize this point into yellow or red.\n",
    "In our case, if the distance between our point and red points is 1.22 and the distance from yellow points is 3.45, then based on the distance we tend to categorize our point to be red.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this we could also state the k value, which is the number of neighbors which we wish to consider for classifying our point. In which we would calculate the distance from those many points and then make a decision. For example we consider our k value to be 5 then, we would calculate the distance between the nearest 5 values and based on the closest group we would categorize its color.\n",

    "                     Distance- SQRT((x2-x1)^2-(y2-y1)^2)\n",
    "Then arrange them in ascending order\n",
    "Then based on the k value take the average of those many numbers which are close to our point i.e. if k=5 we take the average of first 5 distances and if it is 10 we take the average of first 10 distances. \n"
